# Rock Paper Scissors (UI version)

This project showcases some Javascript capabilites, including DOM manipulation. It is a relatively simple program that simulates a Rock Paper Scissors game 5 times, and prints the overall winner at the end (feature still being developed in UI). Please keep in mind that the CSS of this page is pretty simple, as it is meant to represent Javascript capabilities more than anything else.

In this game the user plays against a computer, there are 3 buttons in the page, each labeled as "Rock", "Paper" or "Scissors". After the player makes their own choice a message will display telling them if they won that round. After 5 rounds a definitive winner will be shown, but that feature is currently being developed and for now the player will just be playing forever.
