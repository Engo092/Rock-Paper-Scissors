# Rock Paper Scissors (UI version)

This project showcases some Javascript capabilites, mostly DOM manipulation. It is a relatively simple program that simulates a Rock Paper Scissors game 5 times, and prints the overall winner at the end. Please keep in mind that the CSS of this page is pretty simple, as it is meant to represent Javascript capabilities more than anything else.

In this game the user plays against a computer, there are 3 buttons in the page, each labeled as "Rock", "Paper" and "Scissors". After the player makes their own choice a message will display telling them if they won that round. After 5 rounds a definitive winner will be shown and the player won't be able to continue playing that round, though they can restart the game if they want by clicking the restart button.
