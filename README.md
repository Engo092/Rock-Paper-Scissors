# Rock Paper Scissors

This project showcases a little bit of Javascript capabilites, it is a relatively simple program that simulates a Rock Paper Scissors game 5 times, and prints the overall winner at the end. Please keep in mind that the HTML page itself is completely empty (for now), so this is currently meant to be played in the console.

Once the page is loaded, a prompt will appear in which you should type either "rock", "paper" or "scissors". The input is case insensitive and doesn't care about empty spaces at the end or start of string. In the console it is then shown if you lost or won, according to the usual Rock-Paper-Scissors rules. After 5 times the game ends and a winner is declared. Pretty simple program, and for now without any GUI.
