# Rock Paper Scissors (UI version 2.0)

This project showcases some Javascript capabilites, mostly DOM manipulation. It is a relatively simple program that simulates a Rock Paper Scissors game 5 times, and prints the overall winner at the end.

In this game the user plays against a computer. There are 3 buttons in the page, each labeled as "Rock", "Paper" and "Scissors". When the player makes a choice the computer will randomly choose one of the options as well, and a message will display telling the player if they won, lost, or tied that round. After 5 rounds, a definitive winner will be shown and the game will end, with the player not being able to continue playing, though they can restart the game if they want to by clicking the restart button.

This is the 2.0 version, which adds a significant visual overhaul on this project. The page isn't a simple black and white page anymore, and is way prettier to look at. I even added some of my own sprites for the Rock Paper Scissors buttons, which is something i had never done previously. Other than that, very few things were changed.
